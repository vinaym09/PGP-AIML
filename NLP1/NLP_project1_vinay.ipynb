       "       \"            july 17   this day tunred out so much better than i thought. the leadership training rocked! it wasn't like the leadership trainings in elem, it was realistic, it was useful and, for once, it was actually eye-opening.  &nbsp;  at the start of the day, everybody was, of course, still not vibing it too much since we didn't know each other well yet. there were some people i knew, nicole, amabel and chunky, the badminton varsity cap. i found out that amabel and she are godsiblings. anyway, chunky was really friendly and i really find her cute. our first activity was some kind of amazing race. it was fun! especially in the part where we had to find 4 girls with the same month of birthday. unfortunately, there were only two of us born on january, minnie and i. minnie is the sophomore i see hanging out with the other popular people. she has light complexion, tomboyish air and chinky eyes plus the cutest nose i've seen! she's really nice, a contrary of what i assumed she was. anyway, we had to sing 'nopyi' by bamboo to pass the task. then later, we were asked to do a symbolism of ourselves. we had to draw a shape of a man [like a gingerbread man] and paste 5 symbols of ourselves which we cut out from the newspaper we brought. the activity had a big impact on me. i was confident in sharing about myself and i felt no shame [naks!]. we were grouped into 7. my groupmates were regina, ate marion, ate ira and ate feliz. ate feliz is this sophomore whom i really like. when she was sharing to us her symbol, i found her mature and deep. then, ate marion is the junior who had this smart air around her. ate ira, the senior in our group, was a proof that theresians have poise. she talked with confidence. and regina is batchmate of mine who is the shy quiet type but is the type of person appropriate to be a leader. the activity was one of the things i liked today. it was an eye-opener in a sense that it increased our self-awareness. i think self-awareness is important for a leader to have. because in order to be a good leader, we must know how to deal with people. to deal with people well, we must know them. but how can we know them when we don't even know ourselves? the next activity was a value voting activity. we were asked a couple of questions and we had to choose which answer we wanted. there was a time when we were asked if we had cheated on any exam. my conscience was killing me but i just said to myself, 'i cheated on a quiz, not an exam'. at that time, i really wanted to befriend this senior named, jax. she used to be in basketball varsity. that activity determined our decision-making. i also liked it. in the afternoon, we watched a film called 'dave'. it was about this man named dave who was hired by the government to play as a decoy for the president who had a serious stroke. the chief of staff wanted to hide the truth from the people so he hired dave. things got out of hand for the cheif of staff because dave started to do things which a president should do which the villain doesn't want him to do. it showed real leadership.  &nbsp;  leaders should be responsible and resourceful. they must have a good sense of priority so they can make way for the more important things. leaders must know whom they are working for and must display a good image for everyone to imitate. leaders must pay attention to everything even the little things. because all things, great or small, are significant to all.  &nbsp;  what is a leader?  i have the whole year to find out!   *** &nbsp;  I wasn’t in the greatest mood today. It must have been because I just came back from a fever. It must’ve been because I miss jammi. I dunno, I just didn’t feel too energetic. Plus, I get the strongest feeling that my “friends” are hating me right now. Faith, lara and the others are starting to come snobbish to me. Maybe that’s also one of the reasons I don’t feel so happy. That’s why I’ve decided to keep quiet.  &nbsp;  Today we also changed seats. All of us who always cheat on tests were arranged apart. I guess teachers have that intuition about their students or something. Anyway, it’s cool since I can concentrate better on my studies now and I would be taken from my tempting classmates showing me their answers. It’s cool, at least I can think well from shutting up.   *** &nbsp;  Daryl and I spent lunch together. It was really nice to be able to hang out with her again. She even hugged me a couple of times. I missed those times when we were really close like sisters. Hey, we could always come back to that time…except it wouldn’t be going back, it would be moving on. In a sense that we put the past where it should be and face what’s ahead of us. Of course, it would take time, like everything else.  &nbsp;  Ate alariz has been really nice to me. We hang out every dismissal and I find her really cool, for a senior, she’s really funky. ^_^  &nbsp;  I guess this day is cool….&nbsp; &nbsp;  ***  Check this out….  &nbsp;  What is love?  An irrational feeling  Driving you to the depths of extremity  Pulling the spirit, heart and mind apart  Love is limit-breaking  &nbsp;  It is confusion  Blurring logic  Destructing systems  Breaking routines  Crushing foci  Love is chaos  &nbsp;  It is pain, tears, heartbreak  Love is sacrifice  &nbsp;  It is blindness  Blocking the flaws and imperfections  Displaying mirages of smiles and sunsets  Love is the illusion of perfection  &nbsp;  It is a dream  A basis of paradise  The momentary ecstasy  Love is hope  &nbsp;  It is a feeling  An emotion  A temporary condition  Love is a constant change  &nbsp;  It is an essence of being  A reason for existence  Belief of purpose  Love is life  &nbsp;  What is love?  For me?  &nbsp;  You are&nbsp; &nbsp;          \",\n",

       "       \"           Hi everyone. How is everyone doing this fine Tuesday. I am hoping this finds you all doing well and healthy. My day was absolutely the busiest I have seen in weeks. Today we went to kidnap the R.A.'s for breakfast for floor moms/sisters. We had a great time and our R.A. is super nice and very organized. I like her a lot. It looks like it's going to be a fun first year in Floor Moms for me. We have a lot of fun stuff planned and I am looking forward to it. Later in the day I worked and had lunch at Heather's house with the library girls. We had a great time chowing down on salad and pizza and of course chatting about things that aren't appropriate. It was a great time.  Overall I worked all day and took a mid day nap and that's about all that happened. Oh well, I guess it was a boring day for me but either way, a good one!  Love you all and ~Shalom~          \",\n",

       "       \"           My day started off pretty well, but my cough got much worse.  I hate to admit it but it was prolly my early morning run.  You know what I just realized.  Way back in the day, I think that I picked up the phrase 'prolly' from Kent and it just kinda stuck.  And now, I think about it.  Some of the other slang that I use is been rubbed onto me from others, as well.  I wonder if anyone starts saying 'pop' instead of 'soda'?  *^_^*  Heehee..anyway, I'm feeling mixed right now.  I have a bunch of things going through my head and none of them have anything to do with my 20 page paper.  By the way, I reread what I wrote last week and it makes no sense whatsoever, so I decided to give up and rewrite the whole thing.  I trashed the old paper and began anew.  I already have eleven pages which isn't bad for a day and half.  But still..I'm going to be pretty tired.  I think that I need sleep before I work on my paper.  So much is going on.  I want to quit work so I can concentrate on school.  I want to study for my grad school exams right now and take them.  I want to concentrate on one thing at a time.  Don't worry..I'm just whining right now.  Just feeling overwhelmed from work.  And frustrated because of them.  One job ~ I have to come back during my spring break to work for them because they're already not too happy about me taking off a few days to go to Chicago.  Man..they already made me stay here during winter break anyway.  Sheesh..the other job?  They're requesting me to work 30 hours during my finals week.  I miss Carrillo so much.  I felt much more appreciated there and they didn't force us to work more hours.  And THEY called me.  I was in the middle of coughing my heart out when they called me.  They heard me coughing, instead of asking if I was okay or something considerate, their exact wording was 'Hope that you die soon.'  That caught me off guard and made me want to cry.  I know that I've built myself up to be strong against them, but I'm feeling so weak right now and they just have to beat up on me further when I'm weak.  What did I do so wrong that makes them hate me?  I don't know, and their only excuse is that I was born a female.  I was born into my family.  My very existence is their problem.  They have nothing better to do except berate me...they make me feel so bad about myself...=o(         \",\n",

Haiz, n y ther r pple who like to the calls e shot, e black chinese guy… haiz. Becoz of his character nowadays mi attitude him liao, wa lau, I his senior n nv show repect one lor, e same way he treat other pple, n also suck up to pple one.. haiz… this type of pple, although he has e leadership I muz say. Still can rem last time, when they were sec 2, abt to take over tt time, waaa, damm guai.. listen to me bla bla bla, show respect to many pple, n when take over liao, hack care us luike shit liddat. Smt feel like punching his dark skin face. Anyway, regarding the unit, I tink I can really step down liao lor, now I pass the admin backto Cis, n how they wanna settle is their prob. Oya, even though today I said many times abt attendance taking, I tink nobody in the end took the trouble to take the attendance of their squad. Coz this batch they hac care admin one I noe., b4 becoming NCOs, all dream of goin to trg dept liao, whu will care admin n log????  Also, aft trg heard frm mr.low, tt npcc may be closed down to form another uniform group, merging the police n civil defence to form a home team uniform group. In some sense aft mi givin much tot to it, I think this oplan would be beta coz CD will not be left out, although npcc has courses wif CD. This merge I tink will increase e variety of activities like first aid n other CD stuffs lor. but is sad to hav npcc close down. But I tink this plan may start aft when I completed my years of CI if can lar..          ',\n",

Poets, many of whose works have been inspired by science, would certainly answer in the affirmative, including William Carolow Williams, a doctor who continued to make house calls while becoming one of America's major poets.   On a smaller scale, I am a poet and former teacher who encourages the weaving of poetry into all areas of the curriculum, particularly into the sciences. As a collector of poems for many years, I have seen the power that the right poem read at the right moment can have. Paradox, creative thinking, attention to detail, discovery, humor--a good poem carries many of these elements so critical to scientific inquiry.          \",\n",

       "       \"       I had somewhat of a breakdown this morning.  I saw John today because he finally came to get his car.  And seeing him just put me in a foul mood.  That's not a good sign.  So that was that, we didn't really talk, I just told him to call me when he gets home from work.  But we all know by now that won't happen.  I just want this to be done.  But we won't get into it right now.  I called my mom today and I could barely talk to her.  I was almost in tears, just about everything.  I have my days, but today was bad.  I didn't think I was going to be able to stop crying.  I just wasn't feeling strong today, I told my mom I wanted to come home.  I shouldn't have said that.  She just told me to keep my chin up.  Then she told me a story about my 4 year old niece and I was cracking up.  That's the stuff I miss.    Funny story.  Last night Shelly and I went to get some movies, and I wanted popcorn, but when I got home I realized it was Kettle corn, and I just wasn't in the mood for that.  I wanted something really buttery, so I made her take me back to the store.  We were outside looking at Christmas trees, and I totally tripped over some cement slap and twisted my knee.  How stupid is that?  Yeah I hurt myself looking at trees.    I ate so much sugar last night.  I don't know what it was.  I just wanted sugar.  But anyway, we watched movies last night.  Well I actually watched about 4 movies, because I am an insomniac.  Pirates of the Caribbean.  Good movie.  At first I was a little weirded out about Johnny Depp, but then I was pleasantly surprised.  He was really good in this movie.  Then we watched Old School, and then I watched Serendipity, and then I watched Pulp Fiction, but I fell asleep through that.    So one thing I love about California, is all the bathrooms have toilet seat covers.  I love that.  In Illinois you were lucky to find a bathroom with those things.  Public bathrooms are just so disgusting.  I hate them.  We were in Wal-Mart today and I had to pee, so I went in, and I just cringed.  But I opened one of the stalls and there is the toilet seat cover dispenser!  Thank you soooo much!    Ok, I gotta go, I am rambling on about nothing.           \",\n",

       "       '       The day starts with me waking up at about 10:20 in the morning. This is extremely late for me, but reasonable as I was awake until about 2 earlier in the morning. I was not doing anything exciting, except play Sim City 3000. Me, in Melbourne, on a Friday night- indoors playing a computer game- that is rather sad, even by my standards. I do have an excuse (kind of) though. At 23 years of age- I still have not bothered to get my drivers licence. And I cannot be bothered riding on a train or bus for over an hour from the city to get home either. I only ever go out when one of the major city clubs come out to the suburbs to play in one of the local night spots. I recently went out to a night put on by local clubs,  urlLink Bass   urlLink Station , and the following week, Hard Kandy. Both are more hardcore dance clubs- with faster music and yeah… the kind of music you jump up and down to (and for many people- take your drugs to) I must admit- I have never done drugs of any sort out in public, but still act as if I am on them- dancing like a crazed lunatic. I only go out to clubs in Melbourne very rarely- like once or twice a year. I am not sure if this is because I have grown out of them, or because I generally cannot be bothered leaving my house to go out.   When I was living in  urlLink Brisbane , I used to go out every single weekend to this nightclub called the Beat in Fortitude Valley. I used to think it had the best music, and yeah, I would be dancing up on the tables all night long making an idiot of myself- all without alcohol or drugs. I do drink, occasionally at parties and gatherings etc, but very very rarely out at clubs- water is the drink of choice for me there. When I tried to drink alcohol at the dance club- I found I could not dance very well at all, so I decided that I would stick to water…. That and the fact it is so much cheaper as well! I went out every weekend while living in Brisbane, right up until when I moved to Melbourne- and then all of a sudden I stopped going out to clubs all together. Perhaps one day I will get out there and party on again, but I really doubt it. For a start, I would have no idea as to what to wear to a night out in Melbourne. I hate dress codes- too casual, too formal, no black….. May as well just sit at home and download some music and dance away in the lounge room…. Fun fun fun.  Today is another fantastic  urlLink sunny  Melbourne day, again above 30 degrees. It is meant to be about 37 tomorrow, I am not really looking forward to that, however the warmer night tonight should be fun. It will feel like I am back in north Queensland again…. Perhaps.  Then it is back to work on Monday. I really do not feel like going back to work after so long off on long weekends and sick leave (I had a sore throat the other week, was out of action for a whole week just before the xmas break and all).   Today I decided to go to the garage and vacuum the spider webs from the corners and ceiling of the garage. I have sprayed them all before with surface spray and bug killer- but nothing works. In any case, the garage now looks a lot neater and there are a lot less spiders in it. There were quite a few more than I was expecting, and it looked as if it was just breeding season for the spiders, the majority of which were daddy long-legs spiders. I found quite a few egg sacs, as well as lots of baby spiders. Up the vacuum they went. I have ducted vacuum, so they will remain in the bag until it is time to remove them in about a years time.   There really is nothing more to write about today- it is just another lazy Saturday afternoon…. I don’t feel like doing anything at all, so I won’t. Fantastic.  Catchyas            ',\n",
       "       \"       This morning when I got up I had a sore throat. I normally wake up with this sensation, which I normally attribute to my snoring through the night. I actually did not know that I snore through the night, until one of my flatmates in Brisbane told me so. It was then I was able to put two and two together and work out that it was my snoring that made me feel as though I had mild tonsillitis every morning when I woke up. Because of this, I decided I was good enough to go to work. And so I did.  Before I got to work though, I stopped off at Safeway to get a few essential items. Tissues, lemsip max, and Herron paracetamol. I was attracted to the area that was displaying the Lemsip max as these were a relatively new item. I have never before seen throat lozenges with anaesthetic in them before. Apparently they numb your throat and make you feel that little bit better. As it felt like my throat was on fire- I thought it was a good idea to buy some, and but some I did.  I got to work and had a couple of lozenges. They made my lips tingly, cheeks numb... but little for my throat. Though I must admit they allowed me to talk somewhat. I should not have been at work, but it was too late- I was there and really did not want to go home. Home is 2 hours away. Definitely not worth the bother at this stage.  Not too long into the morning, and a few people around me received emails from one of the managers, asking them to go to the office to talk about a chain email that was circulated late last week. A couple of people had asked me to go into the office with them to face the manager and try and help them out. If I haven't already told you yet, I am actually the union delegate for my workplace. I am getting a little conflicted in this role though, because the more I do it, the more I see that unions are actually quite weak. I have seen cases where apparently, the union was unwilling to assist its own workplace delegates when they got into trouble. This did not impress me much, and led me to think- what would they do for me if I ever needed their help? As well as this, my employer is not really that bad. Infact, I would go as far as to say the conditions there (and the salary) are as good as you would find anywhere in the public service, infact almost anywhere. It is very hard to be effective as a union delegate when you find yourself agreeing with most of what your employer is putting forward. On occasion, there have also been times where I am pro employer and anti union in regards to some of its viewpoints... example- my employer wants us to open six to seven days a week, and late night’s weekdays.... I am all for this- as I would love to sleep in everyday and come home late. This would be the perfect lifestyle for me. But the union, and some employees, are dead against it. I have never gone out on strike, and most likely never will. I think it is a waste of time and I would much rather be working than out in some rally somewhere. Strikes do not work either- the employer is better off by us going out on strike. Think of all the costs like electricity, phone calls, etc that the employer saves on by not having to pay for it because everyone is not there. On top of that- they also save on wages. I am a hypocrite, I stand as union delegate, but I am against most of what it stands for. I am contemplating not running in the delegate elections this year. Enterprise bargaining starts in a couple of months and I would rather not be involved in that process at all. Infact, I might just leave the union altogether. I am already paying the minimum rate payable just to remain financial. Come July one, I might just cancel my membership altogether. We'll see. In any case, I went in with the first of many people who were to be 'counselled' over the sending of a chain mail that promised huge amounts of money (paid by none other than Bill Gates) if they forwarded on this Microsoft related email. I got this letter from about six different people. I do not mind the occasional joke etc, but chain mails really set me off. I hate them. I hate them so much, I did the unthinkable (for a union rep!) and sent them all onto my manager. Everyone knows I loathe chain mails. They should have known better. Also, many people have recently been fired over sending naughty emails in my organisation. Mostly it was pornographic in nature, but in the aftermath, it was clearly stated that chain mails were not to be sent on our network. It could not have been more explicit. Anyway here I was going in to represent someone who is in trouble because I sent their email into the manager. So what, I am a dog, get over it. Lol. The end result was just a verbal warning and a record placed on her file for two years. Nothing too serious. After I came out of the managers’ office with this person, three other people came up to me and asked me to represent them later on through the day. I said if I was still here, I would be able to help them out.  As it turns out, by about midday I was too sick to go on. My throat was on fire. The anaesthetic lozenges were not working. I could not speak. I was feeling tired. It was time to go home.   The trip home was seamless. I get to my train station, and the train to the city pulls up immediately. I get on, and before I know it, I am in the city. Change platforms, and my connecting train is waiting to go. I get off out west, and what do you know, my bus is waiting to go as well. I could not have timed my departure from work better. I arrived home, had a wine (which turned out to be great for making my throat feel better!), and rang the tax office.  After that, I had some lunch- a salad roll with salsa chicken slices. Yummo. I think you can only get this salsa chicken from Coles, as I have not found it at Safeway yet. Anyway after that, I went and had a nap. I was very tired and sick by this time, however when I got up, I felt a bit worse than when I had gone to bed. I just love being sick. Not.   Later in the evening, I had some more red wine- which made me feel better again. I went and watched some big brother. I am glad that Merlin is up for nomination this week. He is such a sook. I cannot stand him being so non confrontational. I was upset that Ryan is not up though; I would like to get rid of him as well. As for last night’s eviction, I was surprised, but glad that Terri and Paul got to stay and extra week. They really entertain me.  I ended up staying up a bit late, but I was not too bothered- after all I am in no condition to go to work tomorrow. Mum called me briefly through the evening, and apart from that- that was my day!          \",\n",
       "       '       Today I woke up sounding like Madge from neighbours. I took the initiative to call in sick as soon as I woke up in the morning (about 9am-ish) because this is when a sick voice sounds its worst. And anyway- I really was too sick to go into work today.  I had my morning coffee and read the paper. I then watched a bit of television, sunning myself on the lounge. Before long I was bored of the television so I went outside to check up on the bulbs and just to get outside. It is very warm for this time of year. It got to 21 both yesterday and today. It will not last for long though, I am sure it will get very chilly in the near future as winter draws on. Actually just on the news- today was the warmest June day in 3 years. So there you go! It was very nice to be outside today actually. Nice blue skies, the sun was not harsh at all, and a nice dry northerly wind. Also today for the first time since I can remember, I smelt the smell of cut grass. Someone nearby was mowing their lawn, and it was a very nice smell. One of these days I should get around to mowing my own lawn here. But I really cannot be bothered and I think it will all die off again anyway by the time summer comes around.   After sitting outside for a bit, I had a nice warm bath. I must have been in there for an hour because I had to top up the bath with hot water a couple of times and quite a few songs played on my cd that I had set up in the bathroom as well. I felt refreshed after the bath, but still sick, with a stuffy nose and all that crap.  I was watching some more television, when I remembered that the transit of Venus is actually on today. I went outside to look at it, but as predicted, the glare of the sun was too bright to look at it directly. I tried to be tricky and tried to use a CD to reflect the sunlight onto a window so I can look at the reflection and hopefully see Venus that way. It did not work. I then went onto the internet to check out the live web cams that were being set up by the CSIRO. I looked it up, only to find it was cloudy in Canberra today. How inconvenient. I then went into some overseas sites and checked out the live web cam on those. I then had a thought- that perhaps a channel had been dedicated to this event on sky news. I was right, there was a channel showing the transit of Venus live. Although, in its news active mode- the screen is really really tiny, only a third of the total television screen space. What a waste. I will complain about that one day when I can be bothered to do so. Anyway I watched a bit of that, only to be disappointed that it was just a loop of the same commentary going over and over again. Not very nice, but still interesting all the same.   I got a SMS from Connex later on in the day telling me that my connecting train home was cancelled today. I am very glad that I did not go to work today. This is a bit of a weird co-incidence as well. The two times that one of my trains that I take have been cancelled- have been on days where I was sick and unable to go to work anyway. I suppose that’s kind of a good thing. It is not so good though for those people who catch a bus that connects with that train at Laverton. Buses stop operating very early here (at about 7-ish). I will have to send in a letter and complain about that as well one day.  I do not think I will be going to work tomorrow. My throat is still sore and my nose is just too runny. I will not bother going to the doctors either, as I have not been asked to by work and I think they know anyway that I am rather unwell by my phone call earlier today where I did that Madge impersonation.   I am very annoyed that the bill is not going to be on TV tonight. Instead there will be some silly ballet on the ABC. I suppose one good thing about this is that I will be able to watch the final episode of there’s something about Miriam tonight. Then I will watch her go into the big brother house on Friday. That will be interesting- especially as all the guys in there seem to be somewhat homophobic. I wonder what they will do when they find out she is a man. What if one of them falls for her? All for interesting viewing!  One other thing that I have been doing today is searching for a new ISP. Apparently broadband is now available in this area in a format other than satellite. I was very pleased to discover that prices have plummeted lately. 35 gigabytes for only $120 per month in some cases, and all that at 1500/512 speeds. Very impressive. I will have a bit more of a look around to see what’s available and yeah, hopefully I will be hooked up in less than a couple of months.  Nothing else for today  Catchyas!         ',\n",
       "       \"       Today was a long, boring day.  I think the reason the day felt so long and boring was because Shawn works from early morning till late evening. I have probably said this before, but I strongly dislike being alone for long periods of time. I guess it's something I picked up from being in jail for 3 weeks and a night. The reason I went to jail was because of false charges brought against me by my a**hole ex-boyfriend.  I can't wait till the 14th because thats when Food Stamps come again. I am getting tired of eating creamed corn :O(  I will have to buy a variety of foods next time so that I won't be stuck with just one thing to eat when I have to wait on Food Stamps again. Of Course, I will have to curb my eating habits so that I don't eat so much :O)  My smoking is under control. I am cutting myself down to 3 cigarettes a day. I feel that after a while on this regimen I can then totally cut cigarettes out of my life. I need to quit smoking, but I have such an addictive personality :O(  My teeth are starting to act up again. I plan on maybe stopping in to see a dentist on Monday. I think it is just a cavity. I hope that thats all it is :O( I should mention this to Shawn, but I probably won't because then he will make me go see a dentist.  Well, thats all for today...     \",\n",
       "       '       Well today is the last day I will be at my parents’ house for quite some time. I am undecided as to when I will be coming back here again. I was thinking I should come up for Christmas- as I have been given that week off work as holiday leave. However, I think it would be way too hot for me to come up at that time of year- in the middle of summer. It was even a bit hot for me to come up this time around- and it is the end of Autumn/beginning of winter! Oh well I will decide something sooner or later. The other option is to come up next August. My partner however in the meantime wants us to go to Bali for a week or so, or somewhere else overseas.   The prices for an overseas holiday are comparable to that of a domestic holiday, so going to either destination is not a problem financially. Perhaps I will go to both- that is, go overseas, and then come up to see my parents in August. I was kind of planning on going somewhere during December anyway in Victoria- provided it is nice and warm- or even to Tasmania. I discovered a tourist brochure for the Spirit of Tasmania, and they were offering 7day holidays, including travel (in which you can take your car for free!) for just over $100. That is an absolute bargain! I will definitely have to go there one of these days as well.   Before that as well, I also have the week of the Melbourne Cup and the Spring Racing Carnival off as holiday leave as well. I am not sure if I will go to the races, or go somewhere in Victoria either. We will see how we go with that. Another factor in all of this as well is that I have an outstanding tax office debt of around $7000- so we’ll see how much they demand to take from my salary each fortnight before I make any further plans about holidays and all that.  Anyway, today I got up at 6:30- and it was nice and sunny again. And as my first day up here, the first thing I felt when I got up was a nice warm breeze blowing over me. I will certainly miss that when I get to Victoria. We never get nice, warm moist winds down there…. Only hot and dry.  I got to the bus stop just before 10am. We got there by taxi. There is something to be said for the lack of hygiene amongst taxi drivers in general (well the ones that I have encountered anyway!), but this one- oh my god…. Let’s just say I was glad to get out of the cab! Anyway at the bus stop I thought I saw someone I went to school with. I did not say hello though. I am a bit silly about things like that. If I am not 100% sure that someone is who I think they are- I will not go up to them at all- for fear of getting it wrong and making a complete idiot of myself. Anyway next time I am up there I will go around town and make sure I say hello. By the way, I am still not 100% sure who that girl was that was talking to me in the shops the other day!  The bus came early, and we got on. I do not mind long bus trips like this, but my mother seems to. We pulled into Airlie Beach and picked up some passengers. It was really nice there- and I was looking at the tourists everywhere along the street. I think it would be cool to just get away by myself for a holiday one of these days. I do not think it would happen though. I would not be able to stay away from my partner for too long (missable!) and I could not come up here for a trip by myself anyway- as my family would want me to come up and visit them as well (and I would want to stay there as well- hey free accommodation!) \\uf04a  After that, we continued our journey south. I read a book that mum had given- Crossing Over by John Edward. It was an interesting read- however I found it to be very similar to watching the television show in parts. I actually do believe in the things he writes about. Call me crazy, but sometimes I do feel as though the presence of those departed are around me. Also, at funerals- I never feel upset. I usually (well ALWAYS) get the feeling that the spirit of the deceased is around me, and that they are very much happier where they are. So I am the one trying to hide my smile when everyone else is upset. I do feel it is inappropriate that I feel strangely happy at funerals for those that die- but the way I see it- they are no longer suffering on earth anymore, and they are much happier where they are now. I don’t think many people understand the way I think about these things- and I know I have offended many as well. But hey- each to their own- I respect the thoughts of others on this matter, and thankfully, most respect mine as well.  Back to the bus trip! We stopped for lunch at some place called Koumala. I wondered if this was some sort of Greek name or is this meant something naughty in another language… probably not I imagined… Koumala is really just a roadhouse with really expensive food in it. I ended up just getting some more lollies to eat. I was not going to pay excessive amounts of money for something that was likely to taste crap.  Back on the bus again, and we passed through some more really really small towns. The landscape did not change much once we passed through Sarina and left the sugar cane country. Near sunset I looked out the window and saw a couple of wild kangaroos. Some of the backpackers on the bus were a bit excited about that!  Then finally, at about 6:15, we pulled into Rockhampton. It was still really warm there, probably mid 20’s. I went to get some milk from Doblos- a local independent retailer. I had wanted to go there because during summer, I saw on  a current affairs show (Today Tonight) that they were offering fuel vouchers (save 10c off per litre) to anyone who bought over $30 worth of goods from their stores. It made the news show because the local Safeway (locally known as Woolworths here) was matching it. (Everywhere else in Australia the discount is 4c per litre). Anyway I was disappointed to learn that the discount here was now only 6cper litre, and only able to be used at local petrol stations. Oh well, next time.  From there we went and visited one of my cousins and had dinner. I don’t know what it is about Queenslanders- but they seem to make interesting interpretations of all sorts of food. This time it was Lemon Chicken, but not how I am used to it in Melbourne. The lemon sauce here seemed to be creamy in texture and looks, and taste. This was something a bit unusual for me, as I am used to the lemon sauce being transparent, and a yellow colour. The rice was much starchier than I am used to as well. I should not bitch about this though, as I used to make food like this as well while I was still living up here. Anyway, because I was so hungry, I had 2 servings.   After that, it was off to my grandparents (otherwise known as ‘the farm’.) I suppose I cannot really call it my grandparents, as my grandfather (on mothers side of the family) died over 7 years ago, and my grandmother lives here with 4 of her sons (my uncles)- who have never permanently moved away (that I am aware of at least!). So I think I will just call it the farm from now onwards.   On the way out, I was absolutely amazed by all the stars I could see in the sky. I had thought I could see a lot of stars from the Western suburbs- but it is nothing compared to what you can see from this part of the world. There was no moon in the sky at all, yet the sky seemed to have a whitish tinge to it- not absolutely black. I could clearly see the milky way- beautiful in its appearance. I thought I could even see the comet that is visiting our skies at the moment! By the time we reached the farm though (just after 10:30pm), I did not wish to go sky gazing anymore. I just wanted to go to bed.   I went straight to bed- without even having a shower or washing my hair. I never do this, especially when my hair has freeze gel through it (and has had it in there all day!) But I was just too tired. Just after 11pm- I closed my eyes and went to sleep.          ',\n",
